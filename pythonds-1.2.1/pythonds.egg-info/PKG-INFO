Description: Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Python
        ================================================================
        
        This book, available from Franklin Beedle, and online at
        http://interactivepython.org defines and then uses several 
        common data structures.
        
        This python package contains all of the common data structures and implementations of some algorithms as presented in the book.  These include
        
        * Stack
        * Queue
        * Dequeue
        * List
        * Priority Queue
        * Tree
          * binary tree
          * binary heap
          * balanced binary tree
          * binary search tree
        * Graphs
          * adjacency list representation
